Docker is a platform designed to help developers build, share, and run container applications.

 ```docker images```

To verify if the image is built successfully.
```docker run -p 8090:8080 -d go-project```

Check if the image is running successfully.
 ```docker ps```

Tag the image.
 ```docker tag go-project:latest <user-name>/product-api:latest```

Check if the image is created
 ```docker images```

Push the image on dockerhub repository.
 ```docker push <user-name>/product-api:latest```
